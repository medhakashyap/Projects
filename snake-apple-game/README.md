## Introduction

This is a simple Snake and Apple game implemented in Java
using Swing. The game provides a classic snake game play
experience where the player controls a sake that grows its
size by consuming food while avoiding collisions with wall
and itself.

## How to Play

(1) Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, and Right) on keyboard to control the snake's direction.
(2) The snake starts moving in the selected direction as
soon as the game begins.
(3) Your goal is to navigate the snake to eat the red food.(represented by a red square)
(4) The snake will grow longer each time it eats food.
(5) The game continues until the snake collides with the wall or itself.
(6) The game will display your final score (the length of the snake) when it's over.

## Additional Information

(1) The snake's head is represented by a green square, and its body is made up of additional green squares.
(2) Food items are respresented by red squares.
(3) The game window is of fixed size, and the snake cannot be wrapped around the screen edges.
(4) The game loop runs at regular intervals to update the snake's position and to check for collisions.
(5) The game stops when the snake collides with the wall or itself, and the final score is displayed.
